            <h2>  DISTRESS CENTRE </h2>
            <p>
                The Distress Centre is a 24-hour crisis line available in Calgary and Southern Alberta. This resource is useful if you need someone to talk to or recommended resources when you are in a crisis situation. The best way to describe the Distress Centre is to use their own words: “We do not define crisis. We do not judge. Anyone can call us day or night.” The Distress Centre can be contacted by phone, email or online chat during the day.
