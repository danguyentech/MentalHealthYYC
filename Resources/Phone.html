            <p>The CMHA is a non-profit organization that builds awareness about mental health and provides individuals
                dealing with mental health issues with advocacy, education, housing, counselling and a variety of
                programs. Whether you or a family member are dealing with substance abuse, mental health challenges or
                even the loss of a loved one, the CMHA Calgary chapter can help with emotional support, life coaching
                and programming, as well as referrals to other community resources.

            <p>
                The Distress Centre is a 24-hour crisis line available in Calgary and Southern Alberta. This resource is
                useful if you need someone to talk to or recommended resources when you are in a crisis situation. The
                best way to describe the Distress Centre is to use their own words: “We do not define crisis. We do not
                judge. Anyone can call us day or night.” The Distress Centre can be contacted by phone, email or online
                chat during the day.
